## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Pre-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Run automated verification
./deployment/verify-production-config.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ All checks passed
# Ready for production deployment
```

### Step 2: Database Backup (Pre-Deploy)

```bash
# Take final backup before deployment
docker exec catalyst-backup /usr/local/bin/backup-postgres.sh

# Verify backup succeeded
docker exec catalyst-backup ls -lh /backups/latest/
```

### Step 3: Deploy Application

```bash
# Navigate to deployment directory
cd deployment

# Pull latest images
docker-compose pull

# Deploy with zero-downtime
docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build catalyst

# Wait for health check
until curl -sf http://localhost:8000/health/ready; do
  echo "Waiting for service..."
  sleep 2
done

echo "✅ Deployment successful"
```

### Step 4: Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Check all services running
docker-compose ps

# Verify health endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/health/ready

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs --tail=100 catalyst | grep -i error

# Verify metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics | grep catalyst_
```

### Step 5: Smoke Tests

```bash
# Test critical endpoints
./deployment/smoke-tests.sh

# Expected output:
# ✅ Health check: PASS
# ✅ Auction endpoint: PASS
# ✅ Metrics endpoint: PASS
# ✅ Database connectivity: PASS
# ✅ Redis connectivity: PASS
```

### Step 6: Monitor for 1 Hour

```bash
# Watch logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f catalyst

# Monitor metrics
# Open Grafana: http://localhost:3000
# Watch dashboard: "Catalyst Production Metrics"

# Check error rates
# Should be: < 1% error rate
```

### Step 7: Enable Traffic

```bash
# If using traffic splitting (blue-green)
# Gradually increase traffic to new deployment
# 5% → 25% → 50% → 100% over 1 hour

# Update nginx config or load balancer
# Monitor error rates at each step
```

---

## Rollback Procedure

If issues detected, rollback immediately:

```bash
# Stop new deployment
docker-compose stop catalyst

# Restore previous image
docker-compose up -d catalyst:previous-tag

# If database changes, restore backup
FORCE=true ./restore-postgres.sh /backups/daily/daily_YYYYMMDD.sql.gz

# Verify rollback
curl http://localhost:8000/health/ready
```

---

## Post-Deployment Tasks

- [ ] **Update status page** (if applicable)
- [ ] **Notify stakeholders** of successful deployment
- [ ] **Update changelog** with deployment notes
- [ ] **Schedule post-deployment review** (within 48 hours)
- [ ] **Monitor for 24 hours** for stability
- [ ] **Document any issues** encountered
- [ ] **Update runbook** with lessons learned
